# Learn from this project

I understand the concept of recursion.

I complete the project in stanCode course by using backtracking, which is the basic knowledge in recursion.

# Try it !

If you correctly implement this program, you should see number of word in below.

      * Input = [f y c l   -> 21 words
                 i o m g
                 o r i l
